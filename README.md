                  1- First, regarding customer data and its impact on the price.
                     * After analyzing the data, we found that there are customers who buy products at                        
                       high prices and there are customers who buy products at very low prices.  
                     * We found that we had to provide offers and discounts for both those who buy a                        
                       lot and those who do not buy so that we could encourage customers who buy to                                     
                       deal with us more and encourage customers who do not deal with us a lot to buy                        
                       more products from us and thus increase profits for both parties, those who buy                                
                       a lot and those who do not buy a lot. 
                     * We also found that there are customers who are interested in specific products                        
                       such as electronics or clothing, so we must provide offers on the products they                        
                       are interested in in order to increase sales and thus increase profits.
                     * We also found that there are customers who use bank cards in purchases and                        
                       there are customers who use cash. Using bank cards in the purchase process is                        
                       easier for us and provides ease for customers and is more economical and                        
                       better. We must therefore provide offers to those who use purchase cards over                        
                       those who use cash.
                     * Providing a service to increase the discount value on purchases when purchasing                        
                       more, so that we encourage customers to buy more from us and thus increase                        
                       profits. 
                  2- Secondly, regarding the products and their impact on the price
                     * First, focus on products or categories that are in high demand and offer 
                       promotions to increase sales. Also, pay attention to products that aren't in                        
                       demand and present them differently. This will attract customer attention,        
                     increase purchases, and achieve higher sales.
                     * Display the most requested products on the website interface to facilitate the                        
                       user's purchasing process.
                     * Make offers on less-selling products so that the user is interested in them and                        
                       buys them, thus increasing profits.
                     * Focus on marketing to less demanding groups, thus attracting customers'                        
                       attention and achieving greater profits.
                     * Adding new categories and products to the site so that we can create a new                        
                       market and change customer interests, thus attracting different attention and                        
                       thus achieving profits.
                     * Adding all kinds of products in different categories to satisfy all tastes
